## Industrial revolutions
- 1st -> steam power (18th - 19th century)
- 2nd -> electric power (late 19th century), assembly line (Ford)
- 3rd -> electronics (20th century), speed
- 4th ->
	- AI
	- Cloud
	- Big Data
	- Internet

4th IR benefits Industry, engineering, robotics, medical, military -> Cooperation, Synergy, Accessibility, focus on our own life
Drawbacks:
- Age
- Pollution (more you produce, more pollution is created)
- Richness (there is a wide gap between rich people and poor people)
- Education
- Jobs (difficulty of finding/creating jobs)

## AR/VR
Augmented Reality -> device that adds a layer (digital) to our reality (like Pokemon Go)
Virtual Reality -> creates a digital environment that the person can enter using their device

Advantages of using AR or VR in a company:
- When working on a machine, with AR you can directly see the data without looking to a computer screen or manuals, with more productivity and less distractions
- Simulations in VR to train airplane pilots, surgeons, etc, better than normal digital 2D simulations on a single screen
- Immersive simulations of products/machines playing in a space with AR or full renderings of space renovations with VR
