What happened in 1949 (year of pubblication)?
- WWI (1914-1918)
- WWII (1939-1945)
- Spanish civil war (1936-1939) (proxy war between ideologies) (coup by Franco)
- Wall street crisis (1929)
- Atomic bombing (1945)
- Rise/fall of fascism/nazism
- Boschevik revolution (1917) -> communism (no social classes) obtained with violence

Every ancient regime was destroyed in Europe -> changes in economy, way of living...

Lenin -> Stalin (totalitarianism, one party as a leader)

These events led to: modernism, new ways to communicate without following rules, to reflect what was happening in the society (no structures)

Literature can't follow the events happening in the world, mainly modernist texts in the years around 1949
