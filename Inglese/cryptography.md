Cryptography (=secret writing)

The way to transform plain text (=normally written text) into something that can be read only by allowed people

The transformation is done with **encoding**

To get the original text, you need to use **decoding**: only the recipient is able to decode the text.

In cryptography, encoding is called **encryption**, decoding is called **decryption**.

**Keys** -> Can be symmetric or asymmetric, depending on the algorythm used.
Symmetric: key is shared between sender and recipient. Use to both encrypt and decrypt.
Asymmetric: two keys, one is "public" and the other is "private". Private encryption -> public decryption, Public encryption -> private decryption
